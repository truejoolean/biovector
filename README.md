## biovector
This is the source code for the (now-retired) website biovector.de

Biovector.de was a job board for jobs in the German biotechnology sector. By leveraging Next.js's server-side pre-rendering, the website was extremely performant which gave us a great google ranking. It's written in Next.js, was deployed via vercel and used Strapi as a headless content management system.
